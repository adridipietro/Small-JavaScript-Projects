# ROMAN NUMERAL CONVERTER

I was inspired to begin this mini-JavaScript project because I cannot ever figure out the value of a series of Roman Numerals. So, I decided why not make a quick converter. This application welcomes those in the same condition as me: unable or unwilling to remember what the letters of the Roman Numeral scale equate to. 


## GOALS
1. Build a place for input.
2. Build two (2) buttons: "submit", to submit our input; and "clear", to clear our results. 
3. Show our results on the page; while simutaneously clearing the form. 
4. Our results should showcase both our input and the corresponding value in a easy-to-read format. 
5. Make sure our input contains roman numerals, and only roman numerals. 
6. Create an error message in case our input does not follow rule #5.
