# SEARCHBAR

I was inspired to build this mini-JavaScript project because I had never built a search bar before in plain, old JS. I have previously created one using ReactJS and it is totally different. I thought this mini project would be great practice and/or refreshment to event listeners as well as "for" loops. 


## GOALS

1. Create a simple input form.
2. Create a "submit" button.
3. Create a "clear" button to clear results.
4. Portray results in a list.
5. Upon typing in the input field, results begin to render onto the page. 
6. Render an error or "sorry" message if input value does not match any data.
7. If value of input matches any part of data item, render the data item on the page.
