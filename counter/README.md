# COUNTER APP

We will be implementing a counter in JavaScript with incrementing and decrementing button functionality.

Let's look at our goals...

## Goals
-Create a button with the inner text of "up".
-Create a button with the inner text of "down".
-Create a button with the inner text of "reset".
-Create on-click functionality on all buttons using JS event listeners and event handlers.
-Once the "up" button is clicked, the counter increments by 1.
-Once the "down" button is clicked, the counter will decrement by 1.
-Once the "reset" button is clicked, the counter displays 0.
