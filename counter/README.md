# COUNTER APP

We will be implementing a counter in JavaScript with "start" and "stop" button functionality.

Let's look at our goals...

## Goals
-Create a button with the inner text of "start".
-Create a button with the inner text of "stop".
-Create on-click functionality on both buttons using JS event listeners and event handlers.
-Once the "start" button is clicked, a counter displays on the page and begin increasing by increments of 1 second.
-Once the "stop" button is clicked, the counter will stop and be removed from the page.
-The "start" button should be disabled if it has been pressed.
-The "stop" button should be disabled if it has been pressed.
