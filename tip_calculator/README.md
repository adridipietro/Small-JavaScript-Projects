# TIP CALCULATOR

Ever have a fantastic meal at a restaurant and then the bill comes and suddenly you forget how to do math? Here is a quick + easy way to calculate a great tip after your even better meal. 

## GOALS
- Enter a dollar amount in the "bill total" field (representing your bill's total).
- Choose among different percentages through either a drop-down menu (representing the amount in percent you would like to tip).
- See the tip amount. 
- See the total amount of your bill + the tip. 
- Make sure bill total entries are greater than zero. If not, raise an error or alert. 
- Make sure tip amount and total amounts only showcase two decimal points.
