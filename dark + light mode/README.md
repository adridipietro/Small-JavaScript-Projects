# DARK + LIGHT MODE APP

We will be implementing a stylistic dark + light mode in this JavaScript mini project via button functionality.

Let's look at our goals...

## Goals
-Create a button that once clicked changes the document's css to "dark" mode
-Create a button that once clicked changes the document's ccs to "light" mode. 
-Create a button with the inner text of "reset". Once clicked, "reset" reverts the document to its original css styliing.
